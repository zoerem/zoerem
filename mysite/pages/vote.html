                        Presidential election cycles drag out about 60% of voters, while off-year elections get an average of 40%<sup><a href="https://www.fairvote.org/voter_turnout#voter_turnout_101">1</a></sup> and local elections, 
                        like those for city mayor, sometimes only get 6%!<sup><a href="http://www.whovotesformayor.org/">2</a></sup>  Why? Our team found that one path to increasing local turnout and 
                        voter empowerment was through simple and easily accessible information and a direct connection to local government.

                    Instead of trying to fix the problems with our first version, we decided to rethink the solution 
                    from the ground up. We realized we hadn’t spent enough time defining our task flows and organizing 
                    the structure, so we returned to brainstorming and started a new iteration with much more detail.

                    This was a huge improvement from our first round. The app functioned and flowed fairly smoothly. But we still had some icon issues to address. At least we were headed in the right direction now, and were confident enough in the structure that I created a lo-fi design system to keep momentum while we defined our style guide.

                    Now that our core architecture was functioning, we added color and texture. While we had solved some of our icon issues, we had also created new ones, so we focused on clarity with our use of icons.
